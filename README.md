PathWise helps you work faster by remembering the directories you visit most. Jump to your favorite folders with simple shortcuts and see how you spend your time.

## What PathWise Does

PathWise watches where you work and helps you:
- Jump to favorite folders with shortcuts like `wj1`, `wj2`, `wj3` (w for "wise")
- See how much time you spend in each directory
- Track your git commits and understand your work patterns
- Learn about your workflow to work better

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install PathWise

**Option A: Using Oh My Zsh** (Recommended)

1. Copy PathWise to your plugins folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/80-20-Human-In-The-Loop/PathWise-ZSH-Plugin.git \
  ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/pathwise
```

2. Add PathWise to your plugin list. Open `~/.zshrc` and find the plugins line:
```bash
plugins=(git pathwise)  # Add pathwise here
```

3. Restart your terminal or run:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Option B: Manual Installation**

1. Copy PathWise to your computer:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/80-20-Human-In-The-Loop/PathWise-ZSH-Plugin.git \
  ~/projects/zshplugs/pathwise
```

2. Add this line to your `~/.zshrc` file:
```bash
source ~/projects/zshplugs/pathwise/pathwise.plugin.zsh
```

3. Restart your terminal or run:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 2: Start Using PathWise

After installation, PathWise starts working right away. Navigate to some folders:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
cd ~/Downloads
cd ~/projects
```

Now see your most visited directories:
```bash
wfreq
```

You will see something like this:
```
PathWise Directory Frequency:

  [wj1] ~/projects          
      ‚îú‚îÄ 3 visits ¬∑ 15m 30s today
  [wj2] ~/Documents         
      ‚îú‚îÄ 2 visits ¬∑ 5m 12s today
  [wj3] ~/Downloads         
      ‚îú‚îÄ 1 visit ¬∑ 2m 5s today

üí° Commands: wfreq | wfreq --insights | wfreq --reset | wfreq --config
```

### Step 3: Use Jump Shortcuts

PathWise creates shortcuts for your top 5 directories:

```bash
wj1  # Jump to your #1 most visited directory (w for "wise")
wj2  # Jump to your #2 most visited directory
wj3  # Jump to your #3 most visited directory
```

These shortcuts update as your habits change!

## Configuration Guide

PathWise has settings you can change. Run `wfreq --config` to see this menu:

```
üé® PathWise Configuration

Current Settings:
  ‚Ä¢ Auto-reset: true
  ‚Ä¢ Reset hour: 0 (midnight)
  ‚Ä¢ Show count: 5 directories
  ‚Ä¢ Track time: true
  ‚Ä¢ Minimum time: 5 seconds
  ‚Ä¢ Track git: true
  ‚Ä¢ Sort by: time

Options: on/off, 0-23, 1-10, on/off, 1-60, on/off, time/visits
Enable auto-reset? (current: true):
```

### What Each Setting Does

1. **Auto-reset** (on/off)
   - Starts fresh tracking each day at midnight
   - Yesterday's data becomes backup

2. **Reset hour** (0-23)
   - When to start fresh (0 = midnight, 12 = noon)
   - Only works if auto-reset is on

3. **Show count** (1-10)
   - How many directories to show in `wfreq` command
   - More directories = more jump shortcuts

4. **Track time** (on/off)
   - Measure time spent in each directory
   - Helps you understand your work patterns

5. **Minimum time** (1-60 seconds)
   - Only count visits longer than this
   - Prevents quick navigation from counting

6. **Track git** (on/off)
   - Analyze your git commits in each directory
   - Shows what kind of work you do where

7. **Sort by** (time/visits)
   - Order directories by time spent or visit count
   - Choose what matters to you

## Git Commit Tracking

When you enable git tracking, PathWise tracks your commits and categorizes them.

### In Regular Display (`wfreq`)

Shows commit count for each directory:

```
PathWise Directory Frequency:

  [wj1] ~/projects/my-app
      ‚îú‚îÄ 15 visits ¬∑ 2h 34m today [25 commits]
  [wj2] ~/projects/another-app
      ‚îú‚îÄ 8 visits ¬∑ 1h 20m today [12 commits]
```

### In Insights View (`wfreq --insights`)

Shows detailed commit breakdown and categorization:

```
üìä Git Activity Analysis:
  Total commits today: 25

  Activity breakdown:
    üêõ Fixes: 8 commits (32%) "bugfix"
    ‚ú® Features: 6 commits (24%) "add"
    üìù Documentation: 4 commits (16%) "readme"
    ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactor: 3 commits (12%) "cleanup"
    üîß Config: 2 commits (8%) "setup"
    üßπ Other: 2 commits (8%)

  Most active project: ~/projects/my-app (25 commits)
```

### Commit Categories

PathWise automatically categorizes commits by scanning commit messages for keywords. It uses a priority-based scoring system - if multiple keywords match, the category with the highest priority wins.

**How It Works:**
1. PathWise scans each commit message for keywords
2. Each category has a priority (100 = highest, 5 = lowest)
3. Score = (number of matching keywords) √ó (category priority)
4. Commit is assigned to the category with the highest score
5. In insights, you'll see which keyword triggered the categorization

**Categories and Keywords (by priority):**

- üîÑ **Reverts** (Priority: 100) - Undoing changes
  - Keywords: `revert`, `rollback`, `undo`, `back out`, `restore`, `reset`, `reverse`
  
- üêõ **Fixes** (Priority: 90) - Bug fixes and corrections
  - Keywords: `fix`, `bugfix`, `hotfix`, `patch`, `bug`, `resolve`, `issue`, `error`, `crash`, `broken`, `typo`
  
- ‚ú® **Features** (Priority: 80) - New functionality
  - Keywords: `feat`, `feature`, `add`, `new`, `implement`, `introduce`, `create`, `enhance`, `extend`, `support`
  
- ‚ö° **Performance** (Priority: 70) - Speed improvements
  - Keywords: `perf`, `performance`, `optimize`, `faster`, `speed`, `improve`, `boost`, `efficient`, `cache`
  
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Refactor** (Priority: 60) - Code improvements
  - Keywords: `refactor`, `restructure`, `rewrite`, `rework`, `simplify`, `extract`, `rename`, `reorganize`, `cleanup`
  
- üß™ **Tests** (Priority: 50) - Test files
  - Keywords: `test`, `testing`, `spec`, `coverage`, `unit`, `integration`, `e2e`, `jest`, `pytest`, `mock`
  
- üì¶ **Build** (Priority: 40) - Build system
  - Keywords: `build`, `compile`, `bundle`, `webpack`, `rollup`, `vite`, `npm`, `yarn`, `package`, `dist`
  
- üîÑ **CI/CD** (Priority: 30) - Continuous integration
  - Keywords: `ci`, `cd`, `pipeline`, `github actions`, `travis`, `jenkins`, `deploy`, `release`, `docker`
  
- üìù **Documentation** (Priority: 20) - README and docs
  - Keywords: `docs`, `documentation`, `readme`, `comment`, `guide`, `tutorial`, `example`, `changelog`
  
- üé® **Style** (Priority: 10) - Formatting changes
  - Keywords: `style`, `format`, `lint`, `prettier`, `eslint`, `whitespace`, `indent`, `spacing`
  
- üßπ **Chore** (Priority: 5) - Maintenance tasks
  - Keywords: `chore`, `update`, `upgrade`, `bump`, `deps`, `dependency`, `version`, `maintain`, `misc`

**Example:** A commit message "fix: add new feature to resolve performance issue" would score:
- Fixes: 2 keywords √ó 90 = 180 points (winner!)
- Features: 1 keyword √ó 80 = 80 points
- Performance: 1 keyword √ó 70 = 70 points

Result: Categorized as "üêõ Fixes"

## Safe Uninstallation

If you need to remove PathWise, we have a safe uninstall script that:
- Backs up your settings
- Removes all PathWise files
- Cleans your .zshrc file
- Lets you keep your data if you want

### How to Uninstall

1. Run the uninstall script:
```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

2. The script will:
   - Find your PathWise installation
   - Ask for confirmation
   - Create a backup of .zshrc
   - Remove PathWise from your plugins
   - Ask if you want to keep your data

3. After uninstalling:
   - Your .zshrc backup is saved as `~/.zshrc.pathwise-backup`
   - Reload your shell: `source ~/.zshrc`
   - Your navigation data is preserved unless you chose to delete it

### What Gets Removed

The uninstaller removes:
- PathWise plugin directory
- PathWise entries in .zshrc
- Jump shortcuts (wj1, wj2, etc.)
- Configuration settings (optional)
- Navigation history (optional)

## Troubleshooting

### PathWise Not Working?

1. Check if PathWise is loaded:
```bash
echo $FREQ_DIRS_LOADED
```
Should show: `true`

2. Reload your shell:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

3. Check for errors:
```bash
freq --help
```

### Jump Shortcuts Not Working?

First visit some directories, then run `wfreq` to create shortcuts.

### Time Tracking Not Working?

1. Check if time tracking is enabled:
```bash
wfreq --config
```

2. Make sure you stay in directories longer than the minimum time (default: 5 seconds)

### Data Not Resetting Daily?

Check your auto-reset settings:
```bash
wfreq --config
```
Make sure auto-reset is "on" and reset hour is correct.
