# üìä PathWise Git Commit Tracker

> **Understanding your work patterns through commit messages**

## What is Git Tracking?

PathWise tracks and categorizes your Git commits automatically. This helps you understand what type of work you do in each project.

### Why This Matters

When you make commits, PathWise learns:
- What type of work you do (fixing bugs, adding features, writing tests)
- How you spend your time in different projects
- Your development patterns over time

This information helps you:
- Share work patterns with teammates
- Understand your productivity
- See where you spend most effort

## How Git Tracking Works

PathWise reads your commit messages and finds keywords. It then categorizes each commit based on these keywords.

### The Simple Process

1. **You make a commit**: `git commit -m "fix: resolve login error"`
2. **PathWise reads the message**: It looks for keywords like "fix" and "resolve"
3. **It assigns a category**: This commit becomes a "fix" (bug fix)
4. **You see insights**: Run `wfreq --insights` to see your work patterns

### Smart Categorization

PathWise uses a priority system. Some categories are more specific than others.

**Example**: A commit message with both "fix" and "update" keywords
- "fix" has priority 90 (bug fixes)
- "update" has priority 5 (maintenance)
- PathWise chooses "fix" because it has higher priority

This ensures your commits get the most accurate category.

## Using Git Insights

### View Your Work Patterns

Run this command to see your Git activity:

```bash
wfreq --insights
```

This shows:
- Commits by category
- Most active directories
- Work patterns over time

### Export Your Data

Share your work patterns with others:

```bash
wfreq --export my-work.toml
```

The export includes:
- All commit categories
- Directory statistics
- Time tracking data

### Tips for Better Commits

1. **Start with a keyword**: `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`
2. **Be specific**: Describe what changed
3. **Keep it short**: One line is usually enough
4. **Use present tense**: "add feature" not "added feature"

**Good examples**:
```
fix: resolve memory leak in image processor
feat: add offline mode for students
docs: update installation guide for Windows
perf: cache API responses for faster loading
```

## How the Algorithm Works

For developers who want to understand the technical details:

### Priority-Based Scoring

1. **PathWise reads your commit message**
   - Converts to lowercase for matching
   - Keeps original for display

2. **It searches for keywords**
   - Checks each category's keyword list
   - Counts how many times keywords appear

3. **It calculates scores**
   - Score = (keyword count) √ó (category priority)
   - Higher priority means more specific category

4. **It picks the winner**
   - Category with highest score wins
   - If no keywords found, uses "other"

### Example Calculation

Commit message: "fix: add new error handling"

- Found "fix" ‚Üí Fix category (priority 90)
  - Score: 1 √ó 90 = 90
- Found "add" and "new" ‚Üí Feature category (priority 80)
  - Score: 2 √ó 80 = 160

**Winner**: Feature (score 160 > 90)

Even though "fix" appears first, "Feature" wins because it has more keyword matches.

### Python Implementation

The logic lives in two files:

1. **`python/constants/git_tracker.py`**
   - Defines all categories
   - Lists keywords for each
   - Sets priority levels

2. **`python/logic/git_tracker.py`**
   - Contains categorization function
   - Implements scoring algorithm
   - Provides shell integration

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is my commit showing as "other"?

Your commit message doesn't contain any recognized keywords. Try using keywords from the categories above.

### Can I add custom categories?

Not yet, but this feature is planned. The current 11 categories cover most development work.

### How accurate is categorization?

Very accurate when you use clear keywords. The priority system handles overlapping keywords well.

### Does this work offline?

Yes! PathWise tracks commits locally. No internet required.

### How far back does it track?

PathWise tracks commits from when you install it. It doesn't read historical commits by default.

---

## Summary

PathWise Git tracking helps you understand your work patterns. It:

- Categorizes commits automatically
- Uses smart priority-based scoring
- Works offline
- Provides insights about your development

Use clear keywords in your commits to get the best categorization. Run `wfreq --insights` to see your patterns anytime.
